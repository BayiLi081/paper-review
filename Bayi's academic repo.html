## Working title

**Review of the interconnetion of residential choice, economic mobility and segregation in agent-based models** or **The use of agent-based modeling for studying the formation of segregation pattern from residential and economic mobility**

<!-- **Using agent-based modelling to interpret the roles of residential and economic mobility in segregation** -->
 
???

## Introduction

Urban economic segregation is a collective social phenomena from household residential and economic behaviours. Endogenous dynamics speaking, residential location decisions are strongly influenced by household statistics, such as income, wealth, education, and family composition. In the economic aspect, the progress in income or wealth level of members or the whole household through the their life trajectories are likely to trigger residential mobility. The exposure of environmental opportunities is also important factor that influence the economic mobility of individuals or households in the long term. These are the main internal links between residential choice and economic mobility. Exogenous dynamics from top level, such as national housing policies, local planning constraints and mortgage interest rates, also have a significant impact on housing decision and economic status. While there are more considerations for household to take the action from a desire to move, 

---

## Analytical theory and theoretical framework

The target of the analytical theory is to be as **abstract, realistic, general and precise** as possible, seeking to explain the urban economic segregation from actions and interactions of individuals.

Open https://github.com/BayiLi081/ABM-Economic-Inequality/blob/main/research_design/architecture/ResearchDesignStructure.svg to view the research theoretical framwork. ([the original github repo](https://github.com/BayiLi081/ABM-Economic-Inequality))

Mechanism-based explanation (hypotheses):

1. The formation of urban economic segregation is the result of the residential move and economic move of individuals and/or families.

2. The residential move is the result of residential choice, which is the result of the balance of desires and affordability which are dependet on their life trajectories and interactions with other entities.

3. The economic move is the result of environmental opportunities exposure and intergenerational transfer of wealth, education and social capital.

REF:
1. DBO(Desires, Beliefs and Opportunities) theory by analytical sociologists

NOTE:
- Macro regulations and policies, as exogenous dynamics, are simplified at large at preliminary stage, being included in the model in the format of variables, but the interplay with other mechainsms will be extended and detailed following.

## Microscopic level

### Micro agent

- Individual

- Housing unit

---

## Mesoscopic level

- the moving house process by the simulation of interactions between groups.

### Meso agent

- Household (group of individuals)

- Neighbourhood (group of housing units)

---

## Macroscopic level

### Macro agent

- Government

- Market

<!-- page 3 -->

## Supplementary information on residentail mobility

## The rules are used to determine where the agents move to

- Households move to the most preferred location that they can afford.

- Households prefer to move to area accessible, depending on the adults' travel behaviour, to their jobs.

- Households prefer to move to the housing size that is most suitable for their family size.

- Households with education-age children prefer to move to the area accessible to school.

- Households prefer to move to the area with the most similar demographic composition.

- Households would have, at least, certain stay length after moving except for important event's interruption. But the longer the household has lived in the current location, the less likely they are to move.

- Neighbourhood quality impact the relocation decision.

- Length of stay built up the social tie, hence the place attachment. However, bad neighbourhood quality may lead to the opposite.

## Economic mobility

### Wealth distribution

#### Self growth of wealth

#### Inheritance of wealth (Bequest)

- To a single agent

- To charities

#### Wealth gathering through household formation

---

<!-- page 3 -->

## Supplementary information on economic mobility

## The rules are used to determine how the agents' economic status change

- The quality of current neighbourhood has a positive impact on the opportunity exposure of the household.

- Single adults are looking for partners with similar socioeconomic status.

- Children are more likely to have the same socioeconomic status as their parents.

- Children inherits their parents' money, and sell their parents' housing if it does not satisfy their requirements, after both parents die.

- The higher the interest rate, the less likely the household with existing mortgage with lower interest rate will move.

<!-- SLR Aims and Questions -->

## Research aims of SLR on ABM-UES


## Research question of SLR on ABM-UES

How former studies design their ABMs on residential mobility and economic mobility? Are they provide any insights on the formation of segregation? Are they implying potential opportunities to be incorporated into one model of segregation?

## Searching methods

### Search syntax

We set the expression "urban\* OR city". (\* expands the search to include variations of urban, e.g., urbanisation and urbanism)

Deriving a more focused result was accomplished by limiting the search to the following subject categories in databases: Environmental Studies, Geography, Urban Studies and Economic Studies.

The search syntax consists of three groups of keywords:

- The first set zeroes in on papers that pertains to 

- The second one aims to delineate publications that engage agent-based modelling.

- The last one 

Their intersection signifies the focus of our review.

### Inclusion criteria

<!-- 货运运输是运输部门温室气体（GHG）和噪声污染的最大贡献者之一。由于空间差异很大，该行业的不利影响并未平等分布，少数族裔和低收入人口更容易居住在与货运相关的设施和卡车路线附近。但是，关注货运运输的股权分析是有限的，因为经验分析需要昂贵的数据收集过程，并且大规模领域的分析具有挑战性。这项研究的主要目的是使用基于大规模代理的仿真框架对货运相关旅行在亚特兰大 - 奇塔诺加 - 诺克斯维尔地区的影响进行公平分析。主要结果表明，在噪音和温室气体排放方面，低收入（不到$ 52K）和更严重的非白人人口社区是处于弱势社区。本文提出的结果和方法可用于提供大型网络中运输公平和社会正义分析的工具，并可用于制定政策和法规，以减少货运运输对弱势群体人口的影响。 -->

## Strategy of further downsizing the literature collection

Speedreading and identify the collection based on some definite criterion.

To reach the target, a scoping review questionaire is designed and hostes on [Google form](https://forms.gle/A5qTHjpAJsCqRCey7).

This form is designed for speed filling with only multiple choice questions.

To take into account all the useful variables for implementation of our integrated approach, we developed an in-depth literature review of related agent-based models. The following table contains the variables collected from this literature review and used in our mixed method approach. We organized and divided them into global (Glo), environment (Env) and individual (Ind) variables, and categorised them by the social phenomena (economic (Eco), residential (Res)) they represent.

| Variable | Social phenomena | Description | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Glo | Eco | The ability of an individual, family or some other group to improve (or lower) their economic status—usually measured in income. | |

<!-- Notes on the review: part i general conclusion -->

## Notes

- Economic variables from micro level usually included as affordability

- Economic variables from macro level usually included as investment to different sections

- The process of "social climbing" (improvement of socioeconomic status from non-spatial factors) was rarely discussed 

- The household dynamics (such as life course or life cycle) were not modelled sufficiently, most of times, the life stages of agents remain through the whole simulation due to limited temporal length or just not included as all.

- Segregation is observed as final outcomes, not constant dynamic pattern. For example, the path-dependence in the development of segregation.

- The urban expansior (e.g., urban sprawl) was rarely considered.

- Most segregation models focus on ethinical segregation, maybe also the reason that economic mobility is not valued in the model

<!-- ![research framework](./imgs/research_framework.svg) -->

???
- Economic-related discussion is normally discussed as contributing mechnism (x)

- The spatial variation of opportunites exposure is widely investigated and modelled, but the aftermath and following implication on further mobility or migration were not fully discussed.

The authours constructed form multi generic mechanisms, combining with baseline model, to generate different model structures. By using niching method, it select the best performing model structure and parameters. Finally, it evaluate the model performance and interpret the results using statistical methods.

<!-- Notes on the literature review, notes spoecially on the housing decision's factors -->

## Notes

- Boehm (1982, as cited in Jordan et al., 2012): **The financial budget** is by far one of the most important factoes when **decision to move** is considered.

  - Harris and Todaro (1970, as cited in Silveira et al., 2006): individuals take their decisions of migrating or not, by considering the differential of expected wages between their present sector and the sector they intend to go.

- Survey-based ABM ((Buchmann and Schwarz, 2014)) can capture a more subtle preference and irrational behaviours of individuals, such as **"I wanted to become the owner" or "I could afford a better flat"**. However, the survey-based ABM is not able to capture the **"real"** behaviour of individuals, as it is based on the **"perception"** of individuals. We can assume a total rational decision making process, but we need to clarify this in our model.

## Notes (example of further exclusion)

- There are some papers regarding to transportation modelling which include residential mobility as a basis to generate trips economic behaviour (not related to socieconomic mobility) or travel behaviour (not related to relocation). It is not identifiable in the abstract, but can be found in the full paper. These will be removed from the collection. (e.g., scopus_56 and scopus_68)

- There are also papers regarding to immigrants and new built up residence. But they do not discuss the housing choice, insteads they focus on the other unrelated social phenomena (e.g., travel bahaviour in scopus_69). These related variables appear in the model as a global variable or parameter rather than mechanims. These will be removed from the collection. (e.g., scopus_69)

- Conditional included: scopus_77 (Yurrita et al., 2022) is the extension of theoretical paper (scopus_4), which purely focuses on technical advancement of efficiency. It is not included in the collection for further theory-based analysis, but it will seperately discussed in the technical review section.

???

---

## Tool

NetLogo, as the commonly acknowledged tool, is widely applied in the collection.

GAMA is also used in several papers (Yurrita et al., 2022).

When it comes to transportation, MatSIM is more founded. There also several models build by Python. 

Or very few used their own developed tools:

- Agent-based integrated Transport Land Use and Energy (iTLE) modeling platform (Halifax, Canada)

  Features:

  - Simulate agents' decision longitudinally at each time step along their life course (Rahman Fatmi and Ahsanul Habib, 2017).

### Model efficiency

The modelling scale will not be upscaled to national level until later phase of PhD, but it is worth to record any technical inspiration during the literature reading.

#### High-Level architecture

<!-- Question on travel behaviour -->

## Question?

- Does the travel behaviour matter in the study?

  A number of former studies of transportation modelling simulated the housing mobility based on travel behaviour (source here), however, incorporating travel behaviour will add a complex layer to the model.

  (Source here) discussed the role of travel behaviour in the housing decision as wider search radius and dissaggreate the travel cost into different transportation modes.
  
  As this study does not focus on micro travel behaviour and I do not wish to grant an overambitious target for this study at such an early phase, the travel behaviour will be simplified as search radius of relocation and the commute cost measurement depending on the transportation mode at least in the prototype.

Among the ABM which based their env on real geographical attributes, most of them distrubuted the agents based on the census data. Only few studies specify the process of creating the synthetic population as an individual section and detail the process (Rahman Fatmi and Ahsanul Habib, 2017).


---

## Baseline synthesis (initialise the baseline model)

It includes two parts: population socioeconomic synthesis environment spatial synthesis

### Population socioeconomic synthesis

1. Generation of synthetic population at the zonal-level (Rahman Fatmi and Ahsanul Habib, 2017), which fits the nature of the Netherlands.

2. Allocation of the synthetic population to the micro-spatial unit of land parcel (standarlised lattice or the real land parcel shape depends on further review and discussion).

3. Assign the socioeconomic attributes to the synthetic population based on the zonal-level data.

### Environment spatial synthesis

1. Assign the land use type to the land parcel based on the land use map.

## Population demographic microsimulation - Life course model

### Life course model

In spite of the rich literature on population demographic ABMs, however, the demohraphic updating component of them tends to follow a certain life routine, which is not flexible enough to reflect the real life course of individuals. Therefore, it is imperative that integrated UES-ABM model accommodate the interactions among behaviours and life trajectories iver the life-course of the agents.

- Local rules of evolution follows probabilities based rules which define changes of state (birth, ageing, death, etc (Edmonds et al., 2008))

- General rules of evolution perform better than locally-based systems to model complex dynamics of evolution of the housing-stock (Edmonds et al., 2008). The user using several logical and genetic operators defines the profile and the quantity of households/housing-units to be added/removed. The additions/suppressions can be considered as disturbances that make evolve the system as a whole.

## Residential mobility

### Tenure choice

- Tenure choice, impacting the demand and supply in the housing market, is found to have dependence on previous tenure status and household composition and income states (Henderson and Ioannides, 1983).

---

## Social network

> Antinyan et al., (2019) find that individuals with similar income levels tend to be connected to each other in the social network emerging in the long run.

Social network will be grounded with actual family tie from the micro data and new social ties such as new family tie and friendship to be generated following social norm, similar with Fu and Hao (2018).

### Behaviour and social network

Three explanations of the relationship between behaviour and social network (Shoham et al., 2012):

- Homophily
  
  individuals could be attracted to others that share their health behaviors and outcomes

- Common causes
  
  individuals within a social network may share exposure to environmental, social, cultural or other factors that shape behavior
  
- Social influence

  an individual's behavior may be influenced by the behavior of members of their social networks (Langellier, 2016)

## Technical inspiration

### Surrogate model

Surrogate model, known as approximation model, is a model that approximates the behaviour of the original model. It is a simplified model that can be used to replace the original model in some applications. It relies on sampled data to define input-output behaviours and to easily explore the space of design.

Yurrita et al. (2022) used the surrogate model to replace the original model in the calibration process. The surrogate model is built by the machine learning algorithm, where a CNN was trained with traffic and solar simulations and was then used to forsee the effects of alternative actions and infer urban metrics real time.

## How do ABM compared to other social modelling approaches in their ability to simulate and predict the development of segregation patterns?

This insights might not be gained through this SLR, as this SLR is only focus on agent-based modelling approach. But it might be mentioned somewhere in the lit collection which worth to record somehow.

### Pros

- Agent-based models are typically advantagous in term of small research unit

### Cons

- Complex layers of ABM may oversimplify the inner factors, ignore the interplay of multiple mechanisms. 

- A all-in-one ABM slow down the efficiency or build a overlocalised model that cannot replicated to other cities.

# Model design

I propose **Groningen, the Netherlands** as the case study of this research. The reason is that it is more a standalone city than a metropolitan region which is more suitable for the preliminary stage of this research. The migration flow in and out of the city system is easier to measure and parameterlise.

## Roadmap to the prototype model

A model environment that approximates the socio-demographic characteristics and spatial distribution of the population of Groningen, the Netherlands.

The first study will be a mechanistic study, I do not intend these models to accurately predict real-world levels of segregation. Rather, I intend this work to highlight potential mechanisms through which social network, market behaviours and life trajectory may interact to contribute to urban economic segregation. Other mechanism mentioned will be simplified for ease of interpretation,

### Life course model

The life course model will be a simplified version of the real life course with **fundamental stages and essential events**. The evolution of household (e.g., household formation, household dissolution, etc), the individual (e.g., birth, death, etc) and the social network (e.g., friendship, family tie, etc) have been investigated and validated to have impact on residential choice (). Most of them will be parameterlised based on probability distribution mirroring the emphirical data; but the evolution of social network have symmetric relation with residence location and household events, which will be modelled as a dynamic process.

### Life course model

Micro- and macro- life events will **trigger the relocation desire** and affect the the preference and affordability of the household. These micro events refer to the life course of the household, such as the birth of a child, the death of a family member, the change of job, the change of marital status, etc; while the macro events refer to the economic and social events, such as the economic crisis, the pandemic, the war, etc. 

However, the macro events will not be included for the research focus reason, but the **more consistent macro regulators** such as the interest rate, immigrants number and employment rate will be included in the exogenous dynamics section.

#### The trigger events 

> Triggering events resulting from the progression in a households’ life course career can be categorised into **opportunities, problems to solve, and radical changes** (Clark & Onaka 1983; Ma et al. 2013).

#### The preference

The preference over the housing unit is based on the **utility of housing** (e.g., the size, the quality, the location, the price, etc), the **socialdemographic characteristics** of households and their member (e.g., the household size, composition, job location, etc) and the **social network** (e.g., the sociodemographic profile of their neighbours, the attachment of their current neighbours, etc).

#### The affordability



*The detail of selection of events or measurements on preference and affordability will be determined from the literature and empirical evidence.*

---

### Residential mobility component

#### Processes

- A trigger aries for the household to relocate

  *The trigger is passed from other components (e.g., economic mobility component, life trajectory component)*

- The household searches for the new housing unit

- The household evaluates the housing unit based on utilities of housing, their preference and affordability

- The household bids for the housing unit on the trade market / The household rent the housing unit from the rental market

- The deal is made and the relocation is completed
