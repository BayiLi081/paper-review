## Searching methods

### Categories of search terms (CST)

- CST1: to identify articles that use agent-based modelling methods.

  ```sql
  (("agent-based" AND simulation*) OR ("agent-based" AND model*) OR ("agent-based" AND system*) OR ("individual-based" AND simulation*) OR ("individual-based" AND model*) OR ("individual-based" AND system*) OR ("multi-agent" AND simulation*) OR ("multi-agent" AND model*) OR ("multi-agent" AND system*))
  ```

- CST2: 

  ```sql
  ((("residential" OR "household" OR "housing") AND ("mobility" OR "movement")) OR "relocation" OR (("residential" OR "housing") AND ("choice" OR "location choice")) OR "migration")
  ```

- CST3: 

  ```sql
  (("*economic" OR "*income*" OR "wealth") AND "mobility")
  ```

- CST4: 

  ```sql
  ("segregation" OR "isolation" OR "division" OR "disparity" OR "uneven" OR "*equity" OR "*equality" OR "*equal" OR "segregated" OR "*justice" OR "stratification")
  ```

One term from CST1 must be used in combination of at least one term from CST2, CST3 or CST4

## Searching methods

### Search syntax

We set the expression "urban\* OR city". (\* expands the search to include variations of urban, e.g., urbanisation and urbanism)

Deriving a more focused result was accomplished by limiting the search to the following subject categories in databases: Environmental Studies, Geography, Urban Studies and Economic Studies.

The search syntax consists of three groups of keywords:

- The first set zeroes in on papers that pertains to 

- The second one aims to delineate publications that engage agent-based modelling.

- The last one 

Their intersection signifies the focus of our review.

### Inclusion criteria

<!-- 货运运输是运输部门温室气体（GHG）和噪声污染的最大贡献者之一。由于空间差异很大，该行业的不利影响并未平等分布，少数族裔和低收入人口更容易居住在与货运相关的设施和卡车路线附近。但是，关注货运运输的股权分析是有限的，因为经验分析需要昂贵的数据收集过程，并且大规模领域的分析具有挑战性。这项研究的主要目的是使用基于大规模代理的仿真框架对货运相关旅行在亚特兰大 - 奇塔诺加 - 诺克斯维尔地区的影响进行公平分析。主要结果表明，在噪音和温室气体排放方面，低收入（不到$ 52K）和更严重的非白人人口社区是处于弱势社区。本文提出的结果和方法可用于提供大型网络中运输公平和社会正义分析的工具，并可用于制定政策和法规，以减少货运运输对弱势群体人口的影响。 -->
<!-- 本文利用基于代理的运输模拟来分析大柏林大都会地区道路交通噪音的示例环境权益问题。我们研究噪声暴露的分布和与单个药物相关的因果关系。此外，分析了社区层面的空间模式。结果证实了基于代理的模型对股权分析的适用性，因为它们可以代表详细的暴露和因果关系水平。我们发现，噪声的因果关系比暴露的分布更加不平等。此外，郊区环境倾向于在大都市城市引起噪音的大量份额。 -->
<!-- 智能增长（SG）是一种可持续城市发展的方法，它出现了限制大都市城市蔓延的弊端。这种方法通过涵盖微观和宏观水平的政策来增强社会公平和环境正义，此外，它讨论了可持续性方面。但是，很少有尝试模拟在不同情况下应用SG原理对新兴行为的影响。这项研究旨在启动一个平台，用于建立基于SG代理的模型SGABM，该平台侧重于社会行为，以帮助管理增长动态并为城市设施管理构建信息数据库。本文审查了文献，并就步行性原则进行了申请 -->
<!-- 全世界许多人都在家里呆了几个月，并练习了社会疏远以减轻冠状病毒的传播（Covid-19）。现在至少有180个国家 /地区可能是一个案件。初步调查表明，Covid-19的大流行使人们感到比以前更加孤独和孤立。这可能是由于对病毒的恐惧，亲人的死亡以及某些国家施加的锁定限制。本文提出了一个参数多代理模拟框架，以模仿大流行期间的社会隔离。使用拟议的模拟器，我们模仿144 km2的现实世界区域，人口规模为200,000，以便具有接近准确的环境。考虑了各种参数，例如医院的数量和能力，感染率，恢复，住院和死亡。模拟在现实世界规模的人工社会上进行了验证，并在很大程度上进行了参数以模拟各种设置。 -->

#### Notes

- Economic variables usually included as affordability

- Economic-related discussion is normally discussed as contributing mechnism (x)

- The process of "social climbing" (improvement of socioeconomic status from non-spatial factors) was rarely discussed 

- The household dynamics (such as life course or life cycle) were not modelled sufficiently, most of times, its settled at start and remain stable through the whole simulation

- The spatial variation of opportunites exposure is widely investigated and modelled, but the aftermath and following implication on further mobility or migration were not fully discussed.

- Segregation is observed as final outcomes, not constant dynamic pattern.

- The development of city (provide more opportunities and housing or another specific pattern such as urban sprawl) was rarely considered. (The environment in ABMs always unchanged.)

- Most segregation models focus on ethinical segregation, maybe also the reason that economic mobility is not valued in the model

- In the economic ABM, investment is more frequent

The authours constructed form multi generic mechanisms, combining with baseline model, to generate different model structures. By using niching method, it select the best performing model structure and parameters. Finally, it evaluate the model performance and interpret the results using statistical methods.

---

<!-- page 4 -->

#### Pros

1. Modulising the model to diversify the model structures to be activated or discarded easily

2. Proposing a efficient and effective method to calibrate large amount of models

2. Integrating statistical methods to evaluate the simulated results and interpret the results

#### Cons

-  Agent-based models are typically advantagous in term of small research unit, using city as research unit may not capture the full complexity of a city. 

<!-- 2. The multicollinearity between mechanism seems underrepresented in the model. When add factors to the model, the model will be more complex and the result will be more difficult to interpret. The increase or decresing of one factor will affect the result of other factors, and effect the overall result. -->

- It does not take into account the exogenous exchange of the FSU systems with the rest of the world

- Using generic model structure is not applicable for all cities at the same time, same variable might only have different meaning in different cities.

???


Agent-based models are typically advantagous in term of small research unit, using city as research unit may oversimplified the inner factors to urbanisation. The material exchange of the FSU systems with the rest of the world is not taken into account. A generic model might not applicable to all the cities in one simulation, which lead to some overrestimation and underestimation of some cities.

A seperation of cities into different groups based on their similarity might optimise the spatial characteristics of different cities.

<!-- Such as complementary supply and demand between different cities. -->

<!-- page 6.1 -->

### Tool

NetLogo, as the commonly acknowledged tool, is widely applied in the collection. When it comes to transportation, MatSIM is more founded. There also several models build by Python. Or very few used their own developed tools.

<!-- page 8 -->

#### Reproducibility

**New challenges induced by this change of topic?**

- When the agents being granulised, the model will be more complex. And the result will be more easilier to be effected by the noise (such as unexpected extreme events like financial crisis).

  But we can seperate time period into different phases, and calibrate the model in each phase like in the sample article.

- The workplace mechanism is important to workers group in their residence decision, but it is hard to acquire the workplace location from historical data for each neighbourhood. 

  We might need to use the estimated workplace location of the city based on literatures and land use data to initialize the model. It could cause inaccurate issue.

???

<!-- page 7 -->

## Causal inference by agent-based modelling

Related parts:

- The interaction between cities based on location and the covariation of the transporation development.

New to me:

- The multi-calibration and niching methods are new to me. It is a good idea to calibrate the model in to subpopulation group, calibrate the model in each group and increase the diversity of the model.

- Using statistical methods can help to test hypotheses and identify the most important variables

???

I think its a great article. I definitely has a better understanding of moduler ABM and the framework of how to composite different mechanisms and how to test and compare the models. It's also an excellent example of how to use ABM to simulate urbanisation processes. And it also shows the importance of the model calibration and the interpretability of the model.
