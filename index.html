## Searching methods

### Search syntax

We set the expression "urban\* OR city". (\* expands the search to include variations of urban, e.g., urbanisation and urbanism)

Deriving a more focused result was accomplished by limiting the search to the following subject categories in databases: Environmental Studies, Geography, Urban Studies and Economic Studies.

The search syntax consists of three groups of keywords:

- The first set zeroes in on papers that pertains to 

- The second one aims to delineate publications that engage agent-based modelling.

- The last one 

Their intersection signifies the focus of our review.

## Notes

- Economic variables from micro level usually included as affordability

- Economic variables from macro level usually included as investment to different sections

- The process of "social climbing" (improvement of socioeconomic status from non-spatial factors) was rarely discussed 

- The household dynamics (such as life course or life cycle) were not modelled sufficiently, most of times, the life stages of agents remain through the whole simulation due to limited temporal length or just not included as all.

- Segregation is observed as final outcomes, not constant dynamic pattern. For example, the path-dependence in the development of segregation.

- The urban expansior (e.g., urban sprawl) was rarely considered.

- Most segregation models focus on ethinical segregation, maybe also the reason that economic mobility is not valued in the model

<!-- ![research framework](./imgs/research_framework.svg) -->

???
- Economic-related discussion is normally discussed as contributing mechnism (x)

- The spatial variation of opportunites exposure is widely investigated and modelled, but the aftermath and following implication on further mobility or migration were not fully discussed.

The authours constructed form multi generic mechanisms, combining with baseline model, to generate different model structures. By using niching method, it select the best performing model structure and parameters. Finally, it evaluate the model performance and interpret the results using statistical methods.

## Tool

NetLogo, as the commonly acknowledged tool, is widely applied in the collection. When it comes to transportation, MatSIM is more founded. There also several models build by Python. Or very few used their own developed tools.

### Model efficiency

The modelling scale will not be upscaled to national level until later phase of PhD, but it is worth to record any technical inspiration during the literature reading.

### The norms in simulation

#### The violation/breach of norms

In Frank Dignum's work of modelling norms in the simulation (To do: find the exact publication):

> We have used both "needs" and "values"to model these criteria. I am not claiming a validity of either of these for all circumstances, but rather show that one can model some phenomena in a natural way using these concepts. E.g. it generated a violation of quarantine norms during covid more frequently during weekends and also more frequent after more time has passed by. Of course, once one has established the pattern one can use this explicitly to model it. But the fact was that we were not aware of this pattern beforehand and observed it from the model and subsequently also saw it in reality. I would say that this is a case where the model has been usefull. Even though I would not claim it is "valid" in a classical sense (which I think is something we should forget about anyway).

## How do ABM compared to other social modelling approaches in their ability to simulate and predict the development of segregation patterns?

This insights might not be gained through this SLR, as this SLR is only focus on agent-based modelling approach. But it might be mentioned somewhere in the lit collection which worth to record somehow.

### Pros

### Cons

> Of course, such contribution is helpful only because ABM can capture some aspect/mechanism/heterogeneity that is missing in the existing models/theories/conjectures but worth to be emphasized. From the technical perspective, ABM provides a specific data structure (e.g., agents with heterogeneous attributes and decision-making rules) and can implement some specific algorithm (e.g., interaction, adaptation, and learning) more flexibly. As a result, by using ABM, some observed stylized facts are reproduced in a more simple and transparent way, hopefully, also in a more convincing (elegant) way. Sometimes, it could also be unobserved dynamics of the system which could happen when some conditions are satisfied (i.e., ABM working as a warning detector).

Agent-based models are typically advantagous in term of small research unit, using city as research unit may oversimplified the inner factors to urbanisation. The material exchange of the FSU systems with the rest of the world is not taken into account. A generic model might not applicable to all the cities in one simulation, which lead to some overrestimation and underestimation of some cities.

A seperation of cities into different groups based on their similarity might optimise the spatial characteristics of different cities.

# Reflection on ABM

Summary from the long email forum from SIMSOC email group

## The key of understanding in Agent-based models

> using the model to understand the target phenomenon. or using the model to improve our understanding the target phenomenon.

Is the understanding gained through a "theory-formation" approach? (REF: [Explaining the Emerging Influence of Culture, from Individual Influences to Collective Phenomena](https://www.jasss.org/21/4/11.html))

Does the model provide (additional) insights for elaborating a (new/better/more validated) theory in regards to the target system?

It could also be used to falsify some theories. For example, the phenomenon could possible be formed without certain mechanism as well.

## Causal inference by agent-based modelling

> However, we need to be extremely careful and not inflate this result. Indeed, ABMs show us that a series of rules A produces an outcome B. But the fact that we observe B in the real world, doesn’t tell us anything about the likelihood of A.

> Indeed, we could produce B also with a completely different set of initial rules. Also, two ABMs that at the superficial level are completely identical may still produce very different results. The result or even dynamic behavior may be completely altered by small variations of the interaction function, numerical representation or even the measurement scale may completely alter the result.

> Dino Carpentras in SIMSOC email forum

> can you show that, **in principle**, your model can produce such outcome as a (unintentional) product of micro interactions?

> whether it has some inherent dependencies between factors. whether a certain mechanism can be held responsible for some part of an outcome, etc. These are not necessarily "valid", but give you hypotheses about how things might function in the real world.

## The relationship between model and reality

> On one hand you have questions purely about model properties: Can _a_ model generate this behaviour? Can _this_ model generate this behaviour? Could a _different_ model also have generated this behaviour? But then you have questions about the relationship between model and reality. So Schelling shows it is "possible" (surprisingly?) to have clustering and tolerance. But this "model possibility" does not buy us anything in the real world unless we can "show" that the Schelling assumptions apply in specific social domains. (And first we have to figure out what it means to do that, then how we do it practically and then actually do it.) But it may be very tempting to "slide over" this fundamental gap between model and world and think that "somehow" pure model results can be used practically. (This even goes down to a "philosophical" level: When you say an attribute in a model is an "opinion", how do you defend that claim? Why could it just as well not be a "savings account" or a "hat size?")

> Edmund Chattoe-Brown in SIMSOC email forum

> Dino's reply about the aim of using an ABM in social science:

> 1. do not tell us anything about the real world

> 2. tell us what may produce some outcomes we observe in the real world

  >  what may be a possible cause or contributor to a certain phenomenon

> 3. show us what is likely to be the observed phenomenon

  >  experimental opinion dynamics which are building a more "empirically valid" update rule; heavy work on validating models; predict some variance in temporal trend

> 4. tell us how reality really works

  >  Extreme hard to reach

> Pietro Terna: **the crucial point is to understand whether the results that emerge from the model derive from a generalizable and referable component to reality or are totally ad hoc and unrealistic.**

## The relationship between model and reality

My understanding: the emerging phenomena simulated by ABM fits the observed one in reality which can explained by properties of your model make it useful to proceed to follow up research or interventions (scenarios design). (reflection on Frank Dignum's words)

## The left-out elements of ABM design

> But the value of any results we get may be compromised by the fact that a) we "should" empirically have included "the media" in our model (logically we should also explain what we leave out as well as what we put in but we don't) and b) because whatever result we find may or may not be of use in the real world depending on how we check the "applicability" of our model. If this model never "applies" then the judgements of "importance" don't get us anywhere.

> Edmund Chattoe-Brown

Question: In our case, we approach the pattern (UES) with residential and economic (social) mobility integreted with life course model. But, are we missing anything substantial in reality? How to validate that we make the right choice of model selection? Not only the mechanisms but also the modules.

This is why I also ask the confounders in the individual paper reading questionaire. If the confounders were considered in the first place and can be introduced as a fixed intermediate variable, can we minimise the risk of deviating from the reality? For example, the 08's financial crisis on will of housing investment. But back to the research, is it even really matter to the explanaibility at all? This is a "black swan event", but a more chronic element, such as macro-level economic lifecycle, should be treated the same as unnecessary?

Can it be answered by SLR?
